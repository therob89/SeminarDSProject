This is the project for the seminar in Distributed System and Architectures.
The goal of this project is compare different Algorithms in terms of, stabilization time and distance to optimality, on Sinalgo simulation engine.

[1] A new self-stabilizing maximal matching algorithm. Fredrik Manne, Morten Mjelde, Laurence Pilard, SeÃÅbastien Tixeuil.
	Stabilization time = 4N + 2M 

[2] Matching algorithm seen in class

[3] Self-stabilization for Maximal matching without Fairness Assumption  Maria Gradinariu, Sebastien Tixeuil
	Stabilization time = O(Delta(max number of nodes that want to act) x m))

[4] Self-stabilizing Randomized Maximal Matching Algorithm

[5] A self-stabilizing 2 -approximation algorithm for the maximum 3 matching problem, stabilizes in O(n^2) steps
